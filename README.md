## Introduction

This project offers a detailed visual analysis of the Year-To-Date (YTD) sales performance for an e-commerce business. It combines various data visualizations to monitor sales, profits, order quantities, and market dynamics across diverse product categories and geographical markets. This dashboard is a pivotal tool for stakeholders to assess the health of the business, identify trends, and make informed decisions that drive growth and efficiency.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:
- **Track Sales and Profits:** Monitor current sales and profits against the previous years to identify growth trends or potential issues.
- **Evaluate Product Category Performance:** Analyze sales data across different categories to pinpoint underperforming or overperforming segments.
- **Analyze Market Penetration and Share:** Understand customer acquisition trends and market share by region to tailor marketing strategies effectively.
- **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Use insights from the dashboard to manage inventory and allocate marketing budgets strategically.

## Dashboard Components

### Sales and Profit Overview
- **Total Sales:** Displays the total sales amounting to $14.11M, with a decline of 5.04% compared to the previous year, illustrated through a line graph.
- **Total Profit:** Shows a total profit of $1.30M, with a slight decrease of 0.46% versus the previous year, also depicted with a trend line.

### Category-wise Sales Analysis
- Categories like **Fishing**, **Cleats**, **Women’s Apparel**, and **Men’s Footwear** show significant declines, necessitating targeted interventions.
- **Camping & Hiking** and **Water Sports** categories exhibit growth, indicating successful areas or shifts in consumer interest.

### Market Share Distribution
- A pie chart breaks down sales contributions by region, highlighting dominance in **Europe (43.37%)** and **LATAM (45.86%)**, with minimal input from other areas.

### Order Quantities
- A 15.02% increase in order quantities against a backdrop of decreasing sales revenue suggests areas for pricing strategy overhaul.

### Customer Acquisition Trends
- A network diagram details monthly customer acquisitions across various markets, color-coded by region, useful for assessing the impact of marketing campaigns and seasonal promotions.

## Utilization of the Dashboard to Address Business Challenges

- **Product Focus Adjustments:** Quick identification of underperforming products for targeted marketing or inventory changes.
- **Pricing Strategy Reevaluation:** Align pricing strategies with the increase in order volumes to optimize revenue.
- **Market Investment Insights:** Prioritize investments in high-performing markets while formulating entry strategies into lagging regions.
